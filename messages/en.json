      "items": {
        "1": {
          "q": "What kind of service is Morfeus, concretely?",
          "a": "Morfeus is a **continuous operational team** that enters your processes, connects data and systems, automates operations, and maintains everything over time. It's not strategic consulting and it's not a one-off project."
        },
        "2": {
          "q": "Do you work on a project basis or continuously?",
          "a": "On a **continuous** basis. We build systems that improve month after month. One-off projects don't allow for control or a cumulative effect."
        },
        "3": {
          "q": "What does “delivery unit” mean?",
          "a": "The work is organized into **slots**: end-to-end units with clear start, end, and acceptance criteria. We don't sell hours, but **measurable outputs**."
        },
        "4": {
          "q": "What changes between S, M, and L slots?",
          "a": "The level of complexity, integrations involved, and operational risk change. Each slot has a **clear size** and a **maximum delivery time**."
        },
        "5": {
          "q": "How long does delivery take?",
          "a": "Each slot has a defined **maximum lead time**. Time is not an estimate: it's part of the control system."
        },
        "6": {
          "q": "Who decides what gets done each month?",
          "a": "We decide **together**, based on operational impact, priority on numbers, and leverage on the existing system. The backlog is shared and governed."
        },
        "7": {
          "q": "Do you use proprietary AI or specific software?",
          "a": "We use AI, automations, and integrations **based on the context**. The value isn't the tool, but the **operational control** that derives from it."
        },
        "8": {
          "q": "Is the system maintained over time?",
          "a": "Yes. Automations are **monitored, maintained, and improved**. We don't leave systems fragile or unattended."
        },
        "9": {
          "q": "Is each new automation independent?",
          "a": "No. Each installed system **builds on previous ones**. This is how the cumulative effect is created."
        },
        "10": {
          "q": "Do you work with any company?",
          "a": "No. We work with **few companies at a time**, when there's real complexity and a will to build over time."
        },
        "11": {
          "q": "Do I need to already have structured processes and data?",
          "a": "You need to have **something real to work on**. If everything is informal, the first job is to bring order — not “do AI”."
        },
        "12": {
          "q": "How much does the service cost?",
          "a": "It depends on **complexity, integrations, and impact**. It only makes sense to talk about it after understanding if we can deliver a concrete result."
        },
        "13": {
          "q": "What happens in the first 30 days?",
          "a": "It starts with a **real pilot**, in production, using the same delivery model. It serves to verify if the system works in your context."
        },
        "14": {
          "q": "How do we know if the pilot was successful?",
          "a": "With **objective acceptance criteria**, defined in advance. It's not a subjective evaluation."
        },
        "15": {
          "q": "And if the pilot doesn't work?",
          "a": "You exit. No lock-in and no continuing by inertia."
        },
        "16": {
          "q": "Is it consulting or an operational team?",
          "a": "It's an **operational team**. Consulting only serves to decide what to build, it's not the product."
        },
        "17": {
          "q": "What does Morfeus NOT do?",
          "a": "We don't sell tools, we don't do one-off projects, we don't leave automations unmaintained, we don't promise results without control."
        },
        "18": {
          "q": "What is the initial call for?",
          "a": "It's a **consultation** to understand what kind of result is realistic to obtain in your context and if it makes sense to act now."
